<h1 align="center">NFT Transaction</h1>

This is the user manual for NFT transactions on a personal computer.
Here are five steps listed to complete the cross-chain transaction on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/).
We take the NFT transaction between Bytom and BSC on Poly Bridge as an example for your better understanding.


At the very beginning, make sure you have entered [NFT Asset](https://bridge.poly.network/testnet/nft) of Poly Bridge and seen the page as below:

### Step 2. Chain selection

And a window will pop up to suggest you **connect your wallet** to this chain when you click any NFT assets on it, 
as shown here:

You can click on the transaction hash to check its status during the transaction. 
Wait for several minutes, and you can check your transaction in **History**.
