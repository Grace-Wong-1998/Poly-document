<h1 align="center">Token Transaction</h1>

This is the user manual for token transaction on personal computer. 
Here are five steps listed for you to complete the cross-chain transaction on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/).
For your better understand, we take the token transaction between **Metis** and **BSC** on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/) as an example.

At the very beginning, make sure you have entered [Token Asset](https://bridge.poly.network/testnet/) of Poly Bridge.

### Step 1. Asset selection

Firstly, you need to select the token you want to transfer. 
As shown in the figures, click Asset, then you can choose the token in the pop-window.

### Step 2. Network selection

After asset selection, click **From Network**, and select the source network containing the chosen token in the pop window. 
Select the target network in the same way.

> The optional network shown in this figure is the network types supported by Metis token. Different networks are supported by different assets. Please choose it according to the actual situation.

Here the figure indicates that Metis token will be sent from Metis to the target network BSC.

### Step 3. Wallet connection

The next step is to connect the wallet. 
You can either click **Connect Wallet** or the **wallet icon** to connect your wallet.  
The difference comes that clicking **Connect Wallet** will enable you to select wallets both on the source and target network, as shown in the latter figure.
