<h1 align="center">Transaction Acceleration</h1>

Poly Bridge releases the **acceleration function** to help users speed up transaction when dealing with congested network. 
This manual will show you how to use this function with the example of token transfer between **Arbitrum** and **Ethereum**.

At the very first beginning, please check the status of your transaction.
When you have submitted a cross-chain transaction completed in Poly, you can click **SPEED UP** to use **acceleration function**.

> If your transaction is only completed in the source chain, this function does not work

Here are five steps listed for you to accelerate your transaction on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/).

### Step 1. Transaction selection
Firstly, you should find the transaction that you want to accelerate. Click **History** on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/) to view the previous transaction, as shown in the figure.

> [!Note]
>- Please ensure that your wallet is connected to **target network**. If not, you are required to switch network first, and then back to the **Speed Up** page. Remember that the network settings in your wallet should be consistent with the target network in Poly Bridge.
>- If you havenâ€™t connected any **wallet** yet, the pop-up window will require you to connect your wallet. After that, exit page and go back to the **Speed Up** page.


If you encounter an error report as shown in the figure, please do not resubmit this transaction. Turn back to your wallet to check the balance.
