<h1 align="center">Transaction Acceleration</h1>

Poly Bridge releases the **acceleration function** to help users speed up transactions when dealing with congested networks. 
This manual will show you how to use this function with the example of token transfer between **Arbitrum** and **Ethereum**.

At the very beginning, please check the status of your transaction.
When you have submitted a cross-chain transaction completed in Poly, click **SPEED UP** to use the **acceleration function**.

> If your transaction is only completed in the source chain, this function does not work.

Here are three steps listed for you to accelerate your transaction on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/).

### Step 1. Transaction selection
Firstly, you should find the transaction that you want to accelerate. Click **History** on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/) to view the previous transaction, as shown in the figure.

### Step 2. Status checking
Then check the status of the transaction and click **Pending**.

### Step 3. Speed-up or fee payment
Now you can click **SPEED UP** or **PAY** if you didn't pay a gas fee for this transaction shown in the figure.

>- Please ensure that your wallet is connected to the **target network**. If not, you must switch network first and then back to the **Speed Up** page. Remember that the network settings in your wallet should be consistent with the target network in Poly Bridge.
>- If you havenâ€™t connected your **wallet** yet, the pop-up window will require you to connect your wallet. After that, exit the page and go back to the **Speed Up** page.


If you encounter an error report as shown in the figure, please do not resubmit this transaction. Turn back to your wallet to check the balance.
