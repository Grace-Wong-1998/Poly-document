## Relayer

A cross-chain information porter performs some of the most critical operations within the cross-chain. It acts as the medium of interaction between the side chain and the outside world.

Each chain in the cross-chain ecosystem has a relayer associated with it. Relayer monitors its corresponding chain network for cross-chain transactions and forwards the respective block headers to the poly chain if detected, gaining available incentives in the process. 
At the same time, it also monitors cross-chain transactions taking place on the poly chain and transfers them to the respective side chain.


## Source Chain

A public chain corresponds to the target chain where a particular asset firstly appears.

## Target Chain

A public chain corresponds to the source chain on which we want to cross an asset and issue a new token.

For the Ether asset, Ethereum is the source chain. 
When we want to issue a new OEP4 token in the Ontology network represents the Ether, the Ontology chain will be the target chain for 
the Ether asset. 

And vice versa, for the ONT token, the Ontology chain is the source chain. 
When we want to issue a new ERC20 token in the Ethereum chain, Ethereum would be the target chain for the Ont network.

## Poly Chain

The relay chain in the cross-chain ecosystem. One of the crucial components of the cross-chain ecosystem. Each type of node is deployed and maintained by other individuals or organizations and has its unique governance and trust mechanism. The poly chain is responsible for connecting them, standardizing cross-chain data flow and interfaces, verifying the legitimacy of cross-chain data, etc.

## Canonical Block

A block is included in the primary blockchain and is directly or indirectly referenced by future blocks. Blocks that are not canonical may have been valid but were discarded in favor of the canonical block.

##  Cross Chain Council

A Council formed by poly consensus nodes.
