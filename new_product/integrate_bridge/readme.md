<h1 align="center">Build New Bridges</h1>

Except for building a new chain, you may want to join Poly cross-chain ecosystem via just connecting with Poly Bridge or integrating the [APIs](bridge.md) provided by Poly Bridge into your own cross-chain bridge.

Then, the listed information will be helpful for you. 

## 1. Main Functions of Poly Bridge

* Monitor cross-chain event  
During transaction, Poly Bridge will monitor the wrapper events emitted by the wrapper contract on the source chain, the lock event (on source chain) and unlock event (on target chain) emitted by CCM contracts.


* Link cross-chain events  
Poly Bridge links the events monitored from source chain, poly chain and target chain depending on the transaction key, and update the status of the cross-chain transaction simultaneously.


* Synchronize cross-chain fee  
Poly Bridge will synchronize the transaction fee of target chain to facilitate users when they initiate a cross-chain transaction. 


* Synchronize cross-chain token price  
Poly Bridge also synchronizes the price of tokens both on source chain and target chain from the market, making users be informed about the exchange rate and accurately calculate transaction fee.

## 2. Integrating Poly Bridge APIs
Even if you want to implement your own cross-chain bridge, you need to realize the four main functions mentioned above.  
And for your convenience, Poly Bridge  also provides some API for you to integrate into your own cross-chain bridge.
You can find them in [here](bridge.md).
